As a very general science, it can analyse any kind of dynamic living population, i.e., one that changes over time or space . Demography encompasses the study of the size, structure, and distribution of these populations, and spatial or temporal changes in them in response to birth, migration, ageing, and death. Based on the demographic research of the earth, earth's population up to the year 2050 and 2100 can be estimated by demographers. Demographics are quantifiable characteristics of a given population.Demographic analysis can cover whole societies, or groups defined by criteria such as education, nationality, religion, and ethnicity. Educational institutions usually treat demography as a field of sociology, though there are a number of independent demography departments.Formal demography limits its object of study to the measurement of population processes, while the broader field of social demography or population studies also analyses the relationships between economic, social, cultural, and biological processes influencing a population.",NA,NA,"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Demography/108703412487935",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Demography",0,NA,NA

","University","The Animal Demography Unit (formerly the Avian Demography Unit), or ADU as it is known in the vernacular, is a research unit in the Department of Biological Sciences at the University of Cape Town. Initially it was built on the nucleus of the South African Bird Ringing Unit (SAFRING) and the First Southern African Bird Atlas Project (SABAP1). The ADU was established in December 1991 within the Department of Statistical Sciences at the University of Cape Town. Over the years, the ADU has grown far beyond its starting point. In January 2008 the ADU was formally transferred to the Deparment of Zoology. At the start of 2013. the Departments of Botany and Zoology merged to form the Department of Biological Sciences.

Our values:

•	Conservation: 	Informing, influencing and motivating biodiversity policy development based on sound quantitative and scientific evidence through our commitment to long-term monitoring and analysis.
•	Partnership: Nurturing partnerships with people, organizations and governments on the African continent to benefit biodiversity conservation and mutual growth.
•	Empowering:	Enabling people to play a meaningful and living role in the science conversation by transforming Citizen Scientists into “ambassadors for biodiversity”.
•	Openness: Adopting an “Open Access” data sharing paradigm that maximizes the benefit derived from data collectively gathered, and thus advancing interdisciplinary scholarly research and informing conservation needs.
•	Innovation: Continuing the pioneering work that has made us leaders in Citizen Science.
•	Education: Providing training and research opportunities to the next generation of scientists, leaders and environmentalists.

WHAT IS DEMOGRAPHY?

Demography is the scientific study of human population dynamics.  The size and the structure of populations are constantly changing in response to shifting fertility, mortality and migration trends. Demographic analyses provide deeper insights into how populations evolve over time and space at the national, regional, state and local levels. As a subject, demography extends beyond the traditional approaches to analysing vital statistics and include systematic examination of interaction between population and development addressing critical issues such as poverty, health, environment, economy and technology.   An understanding of demographic processes and statistical analysis is vital in the construction of policy in contemporary societies. 

The kinds of questions demographers seek to answer include the following, each of which relates to a critical issue that is shaping the modern world:

•	how will continued population growth affect our planet?
•	how can we stop mothers dying in Africa while giving birth?
•	how do we lift the poorest nations out of poverty?
•	how can we reduce uncertainty in population projections?
•	what can be done to tackle the HIV/AIDS epidemic?
•	why does the UK have one of the highest teenage pregnancy rates in Europe?
•	what is the impact of urbanisation on people and the planet?
WHAT IS SOCIAL STATISTICS?

Life is full of uncertainty. Decision-making, whether in the context of a commercial venture, medical practice or forming social policy, is inherently risky. To reduce the risk of making the wrong decision, we need information and hard evidence.  

It is statisticians who provide the data and analysis on which decisions can be made.  The academic researchers at the Division are internationally known for their expertise in the application of cutting-edge quantitative and qualitative methods. Much of our work has global impact, aiding our partners in the development of policy worldwide.
WHAT WILL I LEARN?

Our degrees in social statistics and demography help students to develop a comprehensive understanding of population issues in societies all over the world. We focus on the development of both qualitative and quantitative research skills – for which Southampton has an internationally renowned reputation. In particular, we have links with the United Nations (UN) UNAIDS (the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV and AIDS), the World Health Organisation (WHO), World Bank and the Office of National Statistics (ONS).


Our programmes will help you to understand the issues shaping local, national and global policy in the twenty first century. One of the distinctive features of our degree programmes is the practical focus – you will learn work-based skills that will prepare you for a range of professional careers.

All aspects of demographic research (fertility, migration, mortality, formal demography) and their related research areas are covered. Alternative formats of presentation (e.g. posters) are intended to be established on conferences and workshops to enable young researchers to present preliminary or partial results from dissertation projects, degree theses and smaller projects.
